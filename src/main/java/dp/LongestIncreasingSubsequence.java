/*
The problem is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array.
A subsequence is a sequence derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the
order of the remaining elements.

For example, in:

css
Copy
Edit
arr = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
The LIS is [2, 3, 7, 18] of length 4.

We use recursion with memoization (top-down dynamic programming) to efficiently solve this.

Recursive Approach
The function getAns(arr, n, ind, prev_index, dp) determines the LIS length by:

Deciding not to include arr[ind] in the subsequence.
Including arr[ind] only if it is greater than arr[prev_index].
Key Decisions at ind:
Case 1 (Not taking arr[ind]): Move to the next index.
Case 2 (Taking arr[ind] if valid): If arr[ind] is greater than arr[prev_index], include it and move forward.
Base Case:
If ind == n, we have reached the end, so return 0.
Memoization:
Since prev_index can be -1, we offset it by +1 in the dp array to handle negative indices.
Algorithm
Create a DP array dp[n][n+1] initialized to -1.
Recursive function getAns(arr, n, ind, prev_index, dp):
Base case: If ind == n, return 0.
If dp[ind][prev_index + 1] is already computed, return it.
Compute notTake (skip arr[ind]).
Compute take (include arr[ind] only if it forms an increasing sequence).
Store the maximum of these two choices in dp[ind][prev_index + 1].
Return the result of getAns(arr, n, 0, -1, dp).
Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity:
O(n^2)
There are n states (ind from 0 to n-1).
prev_index ranges from -1 to n-1 (tracked in dp as 0 to n).
Hence, O(n^2) states, each taking O(1) computation.
Space Complexity:
O(n^2) (DP array) +
O(n) (Recursion Stack)
Can be reduced to O(n^2) using bottom-up DP or O(n log n) using binary search + DP.
