/*
You are given two strings, s and t. Write a function to determine if s and t are one edit distance apart. If s and t differ by exactly one operation (insertion, deletion, or replacement), return true; otherwise, return false.

Intuition
To be one edit distance apart:
1. If s and t are of the same length, they must differ by exactly one character (Replacement).
2. If the lengths differ by 1, one string must be obtained by adding or removing a single character from the other (Insertion/Deletion).
3. If the lengths differ by more than 1, they cannot be one edit distance apart.

Key Idea
We use recursion to compare the two strings, character by character:
1. If the characters are the same, move both pointers forward.
2. If the characters are different, try all possible operations:
    * Insert: Skip a character in the second string.
    * Delete: Skip a character in the first string.
    * Replace: Replace the current character in the first string with the one in the second string.
3. Use a memoization table to store results of subproblems (index1, index2, edits).
The recursion stops if:
* No edits are allowed (edits == 0) and the strings differ.
* One of the strings is exhausted.
