/*
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming
a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach
 other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.


This algorithm efficiently finds bridges in an undirected graph using DFS traversal and maintaining discovery time
 and lowest reachable time for each node.

Key Idea
Perform DFS traversal while keeping track of:
disc[] → Discovery time of each node.
low[] → Lowest discovery time reachable.
A connection [u, v] is critical if low[v] > disc[u], meaning v has no back edge to reach ancestors.

Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(V + E)
DFS runs in O(V + E)
Each edge is processed once
Space Complexity: O(V + E)
Adjacency list takes O(V + E)
Arrays disc[] and low[] take O(V)
