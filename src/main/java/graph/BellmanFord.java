Bellman Ford Algorithm: G-41
Problem Statement: Given a weighted, directed and connected graph of V vertices and E edges, Find the shortest distance of all the vertices from the source vertex S.

How to detect a negative cycle in the graph?
We know if we keep on rotating inside a negative cycle, the path weight will be decreased in every iteration. But according to our intuition, we should have minimized all the distances within N-1 iterations(that means, after N-1 iterations no relaxation of edges is possible). 
In order to check the existence of a negative cycle, we will relax the edges one more time after the completion of N-1 iterations. And if in that Nth iteration, it is found that further relaxation of any edge is possible, we can conclude that the graph has a negative cycle. Thus, the Bellman-Ford algorithm detects negative cycles.

Two follow-up questions about the algorithm: Why do we need exact N-1 iterations? Let’s try to first understand this using an example:

In the above graph, the algorithm will minimize the distance of the ith node in the ith iteration like dist[1] will be updated in the 1st iteration, dist[2] will be updated in the 2nd iteration, and so on. So we will need a total of 4 iterations(i.e. N-1 iterations) to minimize all the distances as dist[0] is already set to 0. Note: Points to remember since, in a graph of N nodes we will take at most N-1 edges to reach from the first to the last node, we need exact N-1 iterations. It is impossible to draw a graph that takes more than N-1 edges to reach any node.
